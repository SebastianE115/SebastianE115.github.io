                    <h2>3D Pringing</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to create a fidget toy that can only be 3D printed using Tinker Cad.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget1.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I fist made 9 circles of differnt sizes and made every other circle hollow so that I am able to group them todether to make the circles hollow.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget2.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>After I started to combine them using the group feature and allign feature.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget3.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I I finished combineing each hollow circle with the solid circles.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget4.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then started to combine all of the circles together so that it alternates.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget5.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>After I created to rectangles to place on the top and bottom of the circle to cut out those parts so that the fidget toy can move internally.</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget6.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I alligned the rectangles together</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget7.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>It came out to the dimensions that I wanted and sent it to print</p>
                    <img src="images/fidget8.png" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>This is the final product and it came out like I wanted.</p>

                    <h2>3D Scanning</h2>
                    <p>Jose told us that Jorge really enjoys playing with toy keys, so I decided to laser cut him toy keys. I started by making a basic outline of the top part of the key in Fusion 360.</p>
                    <img src="images/1key.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>After I traced out the part where the ring would go through.</p>
                    <img src="images/2key.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then finished the entire key and made it an accurate length.</p>
                    <img src="images/key3.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>Next, I created the ring for the key to fit through and made it smaller than the length of the hole on the key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key9.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then copied the previous key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key4.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I made some minor changes to the new key. First I changed the width of the top part of the key. Then I changed the lenght and width of the bottom part of the key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key5.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>IFinally finished with the desing, I exported it onto Infinity Designer 2.</p>
                    <img src="images/key6.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>On Affinity Designer 2 I changed the stroke size of the keys as well as exporting it to the laser cuter.</p>
                    <img src="images/key7.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>Finally, I laser cut the design and everything fit perfectly with each other.</p>
