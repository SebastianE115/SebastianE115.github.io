                    <h2>Vinyl Cutting </h2>
                    <p>I wanted to create a sticker for Jorge that he would enjoy. Jose told us that he enjoyed the Florida Gators. Taking that into consideration, I uploaded a picture of the Floridas logo into Afinity Designer 2.</p>
                    <img src="images/1UF.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then traced the logo and seperated it from the pictrue.</p>

                    <p>After I filled in the traced letter with the color blue.</p>
                    <img src="images/3UF.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I copied the F and enlarged it, as well as changing the color to orange.</p>
                    <img src="images/4UF.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then placed one on top of the oter to make sure that they were accuratly spaced.</p>
                    <img src="images/5UF.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then printed them out and placed the F on top of each other.</p>

                    <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                    <p>Jose told us that Jorge really enjoys playing with toy keys, so I decided to laser cut him toy keys. I started by making a basic outline of the top part of the key in Fusion 360.</p>
                    <img src="images/1key.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>After I traced out the part where the ring would go through.</p>
                    <img src="images/2key.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then finished the entire key and made it an accurate length.</p>
                    <img src="images/key3.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>Next, I created the ring for the key to fit through and made it smaller than the length of the hole on the key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key9.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I then copied the previous key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key4.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>I made some minor changes to the new key. First I changed the width of the top part of the key. Then I changed the lenght and width of the bottom part of the key.</p>
                    <img src="images/key5.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>IFinally finished with the desing, I exported it onto Infinity Designer 2.</p>
                    <img src="images/key6.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>On Affinity Designer 2 I changed the stroke size of the keys as well as exporting it to the laser cuter.</p>
                    <img src="images/key7.PNG" alt="Description of image 1">
                    <p>Finally, I laser cut the design and everything fit perfectly with each other.</p>
