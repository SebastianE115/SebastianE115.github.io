                <p>I created a logo for our group based on our final project. Using Affinity Designer 2, I created 5 circles and a star. I then either shrank or grew the circles to become either a tire or a nut. I then changed the colors and inscrived the star inside the tire. I then wrote text on the tire that represents our team.</p>

                        <p>Using Fusion 360, I created four wheels by creating a sketch of a circle, hollowed out the circle, extruded it, and added ridges around the wheel to show grip.</p>

                        <p>I then took a picture of the frame of the car and traced it as a sketch and extruded it.</p>

                        <p>Then I alligned them together and made adjustments to allign the tires with the frame.</p>

                        <p>I added astethic details to the front of the car to make it look more like a jeep.</p>

                        <p>After adding the astethic to the front I created a trunk and a windshield for the the car.</p>

                        <p>Finally I put in final details such as an axel to the wheels and made sure everything alligned to give me a rough model of what our car should look like.</p>
